## Python Tutorial
We will be using **Python** programming language and **OpenCV** (computer vision package) for this course. So before rolling out any graded assignments, it's recommended that you get yourself familier with programming in python. We are adding here one python tutorial + a brief tutorial on OpenCV. The tutorial is a nice way to get you guys started with **Python** and **OpenCV**. After going through the tutorials, you may would like to try out some of the references.
